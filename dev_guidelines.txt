Styling

- use the semantic components as much as you can https://react.semantic-ui.com
- automatically watch for changes in .override styles by running "gulp watch" command in src/semantic folder
- add custom .scss file in the same folder as the .js file and give them the same name

Formatting

- code will be automatically formatter with prettier but but with the prettier vs code extension you can format on the fly aswell
